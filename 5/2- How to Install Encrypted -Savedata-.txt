Make sure the "Savedata" you download match the "ID" of the game

EXAMPLE
Game ID = "XXXX0000" then the savedata folder should be named "XXXX0000"


1. ) Put the savedata in your USB Flash like this
 USB:PS4/SAVEDATA/YOUR_PSN_ID/"Savedata Folder"

2. )  Connect the flash in PS4
2.1 ) Run "Apollo Save Tool"

3. ) Go to "USB SAVES" 
3.1 ) Select the "Savedata" you want
3.2 ) Press "X" on "Copy Save game to HDD"
3.3 ) Say Yes (to resign the savedata to your PSN ID)

4. ) Play your game with your "Savedata"


IMPORTANT

Any savedata that you download and has been copied from PS4 higher 
 than your Frimware Update
 Then it can't be played & "Apollo Save Tool" can't resign it.
